Please read the **Wiki** before running the code in the shared link. 

The code is organized in two folders. 

The folder "**script_raw_files**" contains the code that is necessary to unzip the .dat files, filtering, decomposition, and motor unit tracking. All the raw data is contained in the folder "**rat_data**". 

The folder "**script_processed_files**" contains the codes that are needed to generate the figures and results in the manuscript. See **/script_processed_files/README.txt**
